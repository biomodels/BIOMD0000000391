# Model Notes


This model is from the article:  
**A quantitative comparison of Calvinâ€“Benson cycle models**   
Anne Arnold, Zoran Nikoloski _Trends in Plant Science_ 2011 Oct 14.
[22001849](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22001849) ,  
**Abstract:**   
The Calvin-Benson cycle (CBC) provides the precursors for biomass synthesis
necessary for plant growth. The dynamic behavior and yield of the CBC depend
on the environmental conditions and regulation of the cellular state. Accurate
quantitative models hold the promise of identifying the key determinants of
the tightly regulated CBC function and their effects on the responses in
future climates. We provide an integrative analysis of the largest compendium
of existing models for photosynthetic processes. Based on the proposed
ranking, our framework facilitates the discovery of best-performing models
with regard to metabolomics data and of candidates for metabolic engineering.

**Note:** Model of the Calvin cycle and the related end-product pathway to starch synthesis by Poolman et al. (2000, [DOI:10.1093/jexbot/51.suppl_1.319](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jexbot/51.suppl_1.319) ). 

The parameter values are widely taken from Pettersson and Ryde-Pettersson
(1988, [DOI:10.1111/j.1432-1033.1988.tb14242.x](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.14
32-1033.1988.tb14242.x) ) and Poolman (1999, [[click here for PDF]](http://mud
shark.brookes.ac.uk/Publications/thesis?action=AttachFile&do=view&target=Poolm
an.pdf) ). The initial metabolite values are chosen from the data set of Zhu
et al. (2007,
[DOI:10.1104/pp.107.103713](http://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.107.103713) ). A
detailed description of all modifications is given in the model described by
Arnold and Nikoloski (2011,
